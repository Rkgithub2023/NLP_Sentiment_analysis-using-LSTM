    <h1>Sentiment Analysis for Restaurant Reviews 🍽️</h1>
    <p>This project implements sentiment analysis for restaurant reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The workflow involves:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>🔍 Cleaning and preprocessing review text</li>
        <li>🧹 Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming</li>
        <li>📊 Feeding processed data into an LSTM model</li>
        <li>📈 Classifying reviews as positive or negative</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The LSTM model captures the sequence and context of words to provide accurate sentiment predictions. This approach helps in understanding customer opinions and improving service quality based on feedback.</p>
